# Part one - problems of web dev

* CSS style wars
* Div-soup pages (seen [GMail][soup]?)
  * No semantics of page structure
* HTML isn't DRY
  * JavaScript has multiple ways for addressing that
* Related JS and HTML in multiple places

# Part two - custom elements

* Registered with the document
  * meaningful and beautiful tags
* This inline HTML isn't cool
* Still vulnerable to external styles
* What if it depends on external code
