## Kinds of tests

---

### Kinds of tests

| | Unit | E2E |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"Code"** | jUnit, Mocha | Selenium, Protractor |
| **APIs** | REST Assured, Postman, Karate | REST Assured, Karate |
| **Hypermedia** | N/A | ? |

^
Unit tests usually simply mean automatic tests
the tools too often focus on raw JSON

---

## Tester's first rule
### Tests should mimic consumer behavior

---

### Hypermedia aka REST architectural style

* Linked resources
* Self-descriptive messages (follow your nose)
* Resource representations

---

### How to test hypermedia?

1. Start from a single resource
1. Follow links
1. Perform only requests described in representations
1. Refrain from referencing concrete URLs
1. Do not rely on concrete message format

## Hypertest DSL
### [https://testing.hypermedia.app/](https://testing.hypermedia.app/)

## Hypertest DSL

```
With Class ex:Employee {
    Expect Property ex:salary
    Expect Link ex:manager

    Expect Property ex:contract {
        Expect Operation api:TerminateContract {
            Invoke {
                Expect Status 204
            }
        }
    }
}

With Link ex:manager {
    Expect Link api:subordinates 
}
```

## Hypertest DSL

* Core language
* Media-type-specific dialects
  * Currently only Hydra
* Built with Eclipse Xtext
* [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org)

![right 60% xtext logo](xtext.png)

unfortunately java **and** ecplise
consequence: compile and not interpret
LSP makes editor plugins possible

## Lessons learned

---

## Lessons learned
### Test-first to drive design

--- 

## Test-first to drive design

- Design complex interactions so that they are discoverable by the test runner
- That way they will be discoverable by the client

---

### How the API can guide a client through its resources?
### ðŸ¤“ Demo time[^1] ðŸ¤“

during demo create a project manually and see how it changes the test run

---

## Lessons learned

* API graph !== data graph [^2]

specific to JSON-LD but universal in principle

---

## So is it any good?

- Limited "programming" model
- Not interpreted, unless using Java
- Potential false positives
- Not a replacement for other approaches

---

## What's next for hypertest?

- Language features
- "Code" coverage
- Graphical report
- Editor plugins
- Dialects for more media types
  - Better runner

^
Features: reusability, coverage
