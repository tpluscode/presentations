### Identifier malpractices

* URI hierarchies
* Debating <em>plural vs singular</em>, etc.
* Hacking URIs
* URIs instead of `Content-Negotiation`
* What about query string parameters?

Note:

hierarchies may be useful for assigning URIs by server, but that's it

"Query args (everything after the ?) are used on querying/searching resources (exclusively)"
