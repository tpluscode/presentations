### Reconsider API Versions

1. Individual resource? <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">- go for URI</span>
1. Representations? <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">- don't need versions</span>
1. Behaviour? <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">- don't need versions</span>

Note:

ad 1. resource versions accessible simultaneously - forever

ad 2. introducing or replacing properties? serve both possible duplication. maybe add deprecation to media type?

ad 3. hypermedia guides interaction. follow link relations and react to changed contracts
