### Uniform interface

* Identification of resources
* Manipulation of resources through representations
* Self-descriptive messages
* Hypermedia as the engine of application state

Note:

1. URL, ale nie konkretne schematy
1. client is restricted to the manipulation of representations rather than directly accessing the implementation of a resource
1. stateless, standard methods, media types, cacheability
1. only in-band information (ie. included in request)
